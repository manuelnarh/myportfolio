        <p>
          I build systems that just work. <br />
          From plant operations to Python-driven embedded projects, I design,
          monitor, and optimize electrical systems for reliability, efficiency,
          and safety. I&apos;m fascinated by automation and smart solutions that
          make real-world impact.

            <p>
              I am an Electrical Engineer with a passion for creating efficient
              and reliable systems. With experience in both plant operations and
              embedded systems, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving
              and system design.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some technologies I have been working with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Python</li>
              <li>Matlab</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
              <li>C</li>
            </ul>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not working on engineering projects, I enjoy playing video
            games, photography, and exploring new technologies.
